Subject: Concern Regarding Delayed Delivery of Office Supplies

Dear sir,

I am writing to bring to your attention an issue we encountered with our recent order #8547, placed on 5th August 2025. The order included essential office supplies such as printer cartridges and stationery. Unfortunately, the delivery, which was scheduled for 10th August, has  not yet arrived.

This delay has caused inconvenience to our team, as we are running short on necessary supplies and it is impacting our daily operations.

We value our partnership and hope this can be resolved quickly. Please confirm the steps you  will take to address this concern.

Thank you for your prompt attention.


Sincerely,
Kuriyan John
