Subject: Request for Leave Approval

Dear sir,

I would like to formally request leave from 14/8/2025 to 16/8/2025 due to a medical condition. I have ensured that my current tasks are on track, and I will delegate responsibilities where necessary to ensure smooth workflow during my absence.

I kindly request your approval for this leave. Please let me know if you would like me to provide additional details or make further arrangements.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Kuriyan John
